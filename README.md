What 2 Watch is a collaborative effort to build a web application to allow users to compare reviews of movies they are interested in. This application was built to reduces the amount of websites a user has to visit inorder to get a review for a movie. This web application was built using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) as the CSS Framework, [TMDB]( https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and [Movie Database](https://rapidapi.com/standingapi-standingapi-default/api/moviesdb5/) as the web apis and JavaScript. 

## Usage

The User will be able to type in a movie name and the page will display the ratings and reviews for that particular movie from 2 different apis. The user's search history will automatically save upon search and can be deleted by clicking on the remove button.
